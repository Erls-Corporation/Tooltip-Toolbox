#Tooltip-Toolkit

This is a tooltip plugin for jQuery that aspires to come out as a fully fledged, non-modal overlay solution. 

A demonstration is available at http://tooltip-toolbox.lukasbob.com, which shows capabilites spanning from a lowly tooltip to full, nested dropdown menus.

We're part-way there, providing support for a range of positioning options, and with support for nested tooltips.

Usage is straight-forward: 
    
    HTML:
    <p title="My title">This element has a title</p>
    
    JavaScript:
    $('[title]').tt();

This gives you a straight-forward tooltip, using the element's title attribute.

##Features:

* Never disappears offscreen - knows where the edges are and repositions intelligently
* Support for nested tooltips, allowing for many applications and great versatility
* Full positioning control
* Full control over timing

##Positioning options:

* left - to the left of the target element
* right - to the right of the target element 
* flushLeft - The left edge of the tooltip is flush with the left edge of the target element
* flushRight - The right edge of the tooltip is flush with the right edge of the target element
* center - horizontally centered with the target element

* above - above the target element
* below - below the target element
* flushTop - the top edge of the tooltip is vertically aligned with the top edge of the target element
* flushBottom - the bottom edge of the tooltip is aligned with the bottom edge of the target element
* center - vertically aligned with the target element
